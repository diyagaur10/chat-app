# 💬 Quick Chat

**Quick Chat** is a full-stack real-time chat application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It enables users to send and receive messages instantly without refreshing the page, thanks to **Socket.IO** which powers real-time, bi-directional communication between the client and server.
